                <p>does anyone else struggle to capture their essence in a few sentences? or is that just me?
                    anyways, i like to think of myself as an individual who is able to thrive anywhere. be it in
                    work or my personal life, i find a way to make myself smile as i move through the world. 
                </p>
                <p>if you're exploring my little slice of the internet, you'll be able to find my coding projects under code,
                    my writings under words, and my work history in experience. pretty self-explanatory. though, the design 
                    aspect is a work-in-progress, much like the most worthwile things in life.

                    wanting to connect, collaborate, or even hire me? keep scrolling down to see how to get ahold of me.
